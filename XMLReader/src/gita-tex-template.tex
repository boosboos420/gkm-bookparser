\chapter*{Introduction}

This book is a compilation of blog entries which were posted daily over a period of two years on http://journeygita.blogspot.com. Each blog post contains a commentary and translation of one verse of the Bhagavad Gita. Here is the entry which was posted on day one of the project:~\\

*Om Ganeshaaya Namahaa*~\\

Dedicated to all my teachers.~\\

\textsc{I decided today} to begin a blog that is my attempt to understand the Bhagavad Gita.~\\

I can't remember the exact date, but it was around 5 years ago that I chanced upon a television program in India where a prominent teacher of the Gita was conducting a discourse in English, stripped of all the usual pomp and ceremonial activities that usually accompany a discourse. As I watched that program, I realized that there is something here that is attracting me, but I could not quite explain why. I tried to watch that program as often as possible during my 3 month stay in India.~\\

When I returned to the US to continue my work, those Gita discourses stuck in my head. I began to buy commentaries on the Gita from several authors, and eventually came across a teacher whose audio discourses resonated with me. Now I am looking at the end of the 18th chapter (the last chapter) of the Gita, and having gone through it over the course of 2 years, still feel a need to understand it deeply.~\\

This blog is my attempt to restart my journey of the Gita, beginning with the first verse of chapter 1. But this time, I want to go deeper and understand each verse to the best of my ability. I will keep the language as simple as possible, and provide examples that I and most people can relate to.~\\
